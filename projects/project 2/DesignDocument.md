# Camera App
In this app a user should see a screen that says, "Take A Picture" and then should be taken to the camera where they may take a live photo. From here the user should be prompted to keep or get rid of their picture. After that the app should go to a new layout view which contains my image view and buttons. Here the picture should be available to see and there are multiple effects including Negate, Remove and Greyscale. I have code for multiple effects but I could not get the Bitmap helpers function to work with my code. I was able to keep the picture within my local (_file) but could not get this to my Bitmap and this is where I struggled the most in the App. I would like to make this application also add noise and more effects. MAybe even implement a horizontal scroll view to give it more of an instragram look.
