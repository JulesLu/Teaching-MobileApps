# Post Mortem

From this assignment I got to get real in depth with all of the tools and different ways of moving around visual studio. Virtual Studio is a program I’ve never navigated around and I see that there is a lot you can do with it so it will be exciting to see how much more I will get to learn. I got to mess around with different backgrounds and colors within the design of my application (calculator). It is fun to be able to edit the color/size/shape of all your variables in the app and it opens up a huge Learning what does what makes coding here a lot easier so familiarize yourself with everything at first. I struggled with organization in my code and also getting my switch statement/ logic down. Really sit down and understand the logic of the calculator before you try and tackle this project. You need to know how it works and you need to select a data type to help you complete this. I chose a stack and had a hard time using this at first but then figured out how it works with C#, using the internet is really helpful with navigating around errors in your app. The biggest thing I learned from making this app is it is best to have click events attached to your functions or event handlers. Trying to implement functions into each click can be hard if not impossible to do sometimes. So, it is best to group everything, from event handlers, to button clicks and all your variables. The most fun part of this project is seeing your app actually do stuff, my app sadly didn’t get up to running 100% but it was still amazing to see how your calculator could still type items to the screen. Gives you an idea of the potential of where you can go with these apps, there are so many different tools and abilities, you just have to get use to the way visual studio works. The most challenging part of this assignment was the fact that I didn’t really know how visual studio works or what any of the tools did. So after I got use to that it made it a bit easier, another part again was the logic. You HAVE to understand the logic behind the calculator to make this app easier to make. It was a struggle figuring out everything and I wish I had a completed app but I learned it is best to at least have something working, even if it is a lower level calculator or only some parts work. Take baby steps not a huge leap to a finished project because this makes a big difference in your code and will help moving forward.
