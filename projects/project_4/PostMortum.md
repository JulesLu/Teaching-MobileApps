# Post Mortem
I decided to rewrite my project 3 within Android studio for project 4. This app was one where we had to get familiar with the Google API 
and send an image to the google api then receive its "contents" or a guess of what you have taken a picture of. In this App I was having 
a tough time grabbing the image from the camera again, which was something I had to really work around, creating new loops and variable 
checks to try and get my image view to take the bitmap. I also had problems with how quickly my app would send the picture to the google 
api, seems I needed to reduce the quality of the image being sent off. I did this in hopes of making my application run faster.. A problem 
I did not work around is how to make the gallery to work, I still have not had the time to really dive into this and this was something I
was really looking forward to implementing in this project. The most fun part of this assignment was seeing how the google Api works and 
realizing the potential that it has, I really focused on trying to make this app have multiple view to make it prettier for the user.  I
hope that I can turn this app into a game in the near future, maybe into an I Spy or even a charade type game. The most difficult part of
this assignment for me was getting the Google Api to respond and getting familiarized with the different functions calls that the API uses
and seeing how information is moved here. This is still a hard feat and I had to mess with my gradle and android manifest settings to be
able to make this program work. It forced me to learn some Java as well,  since this is something I am unfamiliar with. If I was to i
mprove the assignment I would add both a gallery button, take a new picture button, a yes and a no button that lead to more user input
and my results will be based off this. . The gallery and take a new picture buttons would give the user the opportunity to do what they
want with the app, not just be set to only taking a picture. The Yes and No buttons are used to help the user say if the guessed image 
is actually what they took a picture of or not. I would also like to implement a function in the google API that would give a description
of what the picture is in percentages. I also thought of improving this app to give you pictures and you have to type what it a picture 
is of and if you are correct then you get the right picture. There is a time limit and it is you against another player. This assignment
was really challenging for me and I wish I was able to implement more but I learned a lot about the functionality of the Google APi and 
figured out how to use service keys and a lot of different features. This helped me dive into android studio and let me get a hang of 
things so I can try and tackle it for my final project.
